Web Serial to Arduino Gamepad
=================

Use your web browser (currently Chrome version 80 or newer only) to capture game pad inputs and forward them to an Arduino over Serial. 
The Arduino sketch then sends the inputs to a classic video game console (currently NES & SNES are supported) or Dinput.
Support for up to 4 game pads in and out.
