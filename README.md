# Web Serial to Arduino Gamepad

Use your web browser (currently Chrome version 78 or newer only) to capture game pad inputs and forward them to an Arduino over Serial.
The Arduino sketch then sends the inputs to a classic video game console (currently NES & SNES are supported) or Dinput.
Support for up to 4 game pads in and out (coming soon).

You will need to enable Chrome's **Experimental Web Platform Features** by visiting **chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features**

This is very much in **alpha** with **lots** of bugs, typos, ugly code and missing credits.

Upcoming functionality:
  * Button remapping  
  * NES skin  
  * Mutiple (4) controller inputs/outputs  
  * Multitap emulation  
  * Controller to controller remapping  
  * Genesis/Mega Drive output and skin  
  * PSX output and skin  
  * N64 output and skin  

## Further information

Coming soon...
